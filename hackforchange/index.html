    <h2>Proposed Project Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Expectations:</b> We are looking for projects that can be completed in 2 working days by a team of 4 - 10 people. </li> 
      <li><b>Skillsets:</b> The variety of skills/backgrounds of attendees will include developers, project managers, community organizers, designers, researchers, marketers, government staff, urbanists, and active citizens. It is important that projects are able to use a variety of skillsets and expertise levels, especially given that our attendees come from varied backgrounds. </li>
      <li><b>Challenges/Goals:</b> All projects must address a component of how to improve San Franciso. They mush have clearly articulated challenges and tangible goals. They need to be designed for 4 - 10 person teams, with scaleable goals to fit your team's size. The more 'ready for execution' the project, the better. </li>
      <li><b>Project Lead:</b> Each project requires a project lead to see the project from start to finish, and attending the 3-day event. If someone cannot attend one of the days, it is okay for two people to collaborative lead the team.    </li>
      <li><b>Timeline:</b> Friday night: project leads recruit members to their challenge at the Opening Party. Saturday and Sunday: working on projects. Sunday late afternoon: each project presents their work to the group. </li>
