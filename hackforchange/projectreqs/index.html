    <h1>Project Requirements</h1>
    <p>Thousands of people from across the United States will come together to build new solutions to improve our communities and the governments that serve them during the <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>. Passionate neighbors, urbanists, civic hackers, developers, designers, government staff, and community organizers will unite around building tools for San Francisco. Come to join a project to tackle specific challenges, to interview residents for user testing, to hone skills at workshops, or to build a stronger SF with your neighbors. </p>
