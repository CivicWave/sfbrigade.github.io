      <li><b>Propose a Project:</b> Do you have an idea for a project that you want to see happen? Or want to continue work on a project that fits within the theme? Excited about pitching your idea and leading a team through tangible goals? Read the <a href="http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/hackforchange/projectreqs/">Project Requirements</a> and fill out form (on the Project Req's page) to have your project at NDoCH. Requirements: prep time to develop the idea and action plan for your project, recruiting a team during the Friday night opening party, attending Saturday and Sunday to work on the project, and presenting with your team on Sunday night.

      <li><b>Lead a Challenge:</b>Do you want to be the point person for a challenge? Challenges are projects that have been set up and released by Code for America for this year's National Day of Civic Hacking. This could be taking a project from another city and adapting it to San Francisco, or turning a data set into a visualization, or plenty of other things. Requirements: some prep time to look up the needs of the project (up to 5 hours), recruiting a team during the Fri event, attending Sat/Sun to work on the challenge. You do not need technical expertise to lead a challenge. </li>
