    <p>San Francisco is the global hub for technological innovation. Yet there exists serious tension between those who feel the benefits of that innovation and those who do not. Further, 2015 marks the 100th anniversaries of both the Panama-Pacific International
      Exposition (World’s Fair), the rebuilding of City Hall following the 1906 earthquake and fire, and the launch of Mayor Ed Lee’s Shared Prosperity Agenda. </p>

    <br />
    <p>The time is ripe for an event to inspire the various communities of San Francisco around shared action to “hack” the civic fabric of The City. </p>

    <br />
    <p>Code for San Francisco, a Code for America “brigade”, will bring together 300-400 community organizers, civic hackers, developers, designers, government staff, and passionate neighbors around challenges and projects on open data, housing, health,
      education, transportation, women’s empowerment, and anti-poverty. </p>

    <br />
    <p>The National Day of Civic Hacking is a chance for residents to prototype and test out their own solutions in these same issue areas, offering complementary projects to those being created primarily by the Government under the Mayor’s Shared Prosperity
      Agenda.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>Afterwards, projects created will be incubated within the Code for San Francisco weekly hack night environment during our self-proclaimed Summer of Civic Tech, ensuring that the ideas and efforts are sustained well-past the event weekend.</p>

    <br />
    <p>The event will also launch both a Summer Mentorship Program in partnership with Girl Develop It! and Girls Who Code and a “Civic User Testing” Group, which will generate greater buy-in from people using government and civic-oriented services and apps.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>We are proud to offer this opportunity to discover, network, and hack San Francisco, and we hope you will help us reach our goals by supporting this global movement on a local level.</p>
